**Background**: I am an Engineering Analyst at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/engineering/), where I work mainly on Low-latency Systems for trading financial instruments. Before joining Goldman Sachs, I obtained a bachelor's degree in [Computer Engineering](https://coe.knust.edu.gh/) from the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), where I graduated as the [Valedictorian of the University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruomzU77mvk&t=642s) and set a [record](https://twitter.com/mcfspatknust/status/1307272053796622337) for the highest Cummulative Weighted Average (88.45) in the University's 69-year history. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to carry out interdisciplinary research in applied machine learning at the [Connected Devices Lab](http://connecteddeviceslab.org), touching across areas such as health, transportation, and affective computing.

**Research Interests**: My primary interests include distributed systems, databases, machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and parallel computing.  I am very interested in working at the intersection of Systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) to build the next generation of computer systems that would allow us to fully harness the power of AI/ML for solving problems. I am very open to exploring new fields and learning about new things. 

I  have built a couple of failed startups :) and I am currently building [Reoplex](https://reoplex.vercel.app/);  Africa's next marketplace with a couple of brilliant people. I spend most of my free time helping to run the [Anansi Mentorship]() program and volunteering on [other give-back initiatives](https://www.hermannkumbong.com/#:~:text=Community%20Engagement).
