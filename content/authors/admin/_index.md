I am an Engineering Analyst at Goldman Sachs where I work mainly in the areas of Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. My primary interests include distributed systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence and algorithms, and programmable matter. Prior to joining Goldman Sachs, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, with a large emphasis on Systems. During my undergraduate studies,

I was fortunate to carry out applied machine learning at the Connected Devices Lab
