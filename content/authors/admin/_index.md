**Background**: I am an Engineering Analyst (fancy term for Software/Systems Engineer)  at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/engineering/), where I work mainly on Low-latency Systems for trading financial instruments. Before joining Goldman Sachs, I obtained a bachelor's degree in [Computer Engineering](https://coe.knust.edu.gh/) from the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), where I graduated as the [Valedictorian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruomzU77mvk&t=642s) of the University and set a [record](https://twitter.com/mcfspatknust/status/1307272053796622337) for the highest Cummulative Weighted Average in the University's 69-year history. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to carry out interdisciplinary research in applied machine learning at the [Connected Devices Lab](http://connecteddeviceslab.org), touching across areas such as health, transportation, and affective computing.

**Research Interests**: My primary interests include distributed systems, databases, machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and parallel computing.  I am very interested in working at the intersection between Systems and AI/ML to build the next generation of systems that would enable AI/ML to be used to solve some of the world's most complex and critical problems. I am very open to exploring new fields and learning about new things.

**Community Engagement**: I am very passionate about mentoring others and helping them realize their full potential. I co-founded [Anansi Mentorship](), with [@Twum-Ampofo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kofiapeakorang/) and [@Ermyntrude](https://mcfscholars.asu.edu/scholars/phase-ii-scholars/ermyntrude-adjei), together we are helping bridge the gap between students from Universities in Africa and opportunities around the globe. I am also a mentor on the [Elevate Mentorship program](https://sites.google.com/miafrik.org/elevate/about-us/our-mentors) and [Open Dreams Organization](https://www.open-dreams.org/).
