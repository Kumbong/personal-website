**Background**: I am an Engineering Analyst (fancy term for Software/Systems Engineer)  at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/engineering/) where I work mainly on Low-latency Distributed Systems for trading financial instruments. Before joining Goldman Sachs, I obtained a bachelor's degree in [Computer Engineering](https://coe.knust.edu.gh/) from the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/), focusing on Systems. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to carry out interdisciplinary research in applied machine learning at the [Connected Devices Lab](http://connecteddeviceslab.org) touching across areas such as health, transportation, and affective computing.

**Interests**: My primary interests include distributed systems, databases, machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and parallel computing.  I am very interested in working in the intersection between Systems and AI/ML to build the next generation of systems that would enable AI/ML to be used to solve some of the world's most complex and critical problems. I am quite open to exploring new fields and learning about new things.
