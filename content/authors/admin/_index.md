I am an Engineering Analyst (fancy term in the finance world for Software Engineer)  at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) where I work mainly on Low-latency Distributed Systems for trading financial products. My primary interests include distributed systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence and algorithms, and programmable matter. Prior to joining Goldman Sachs, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, with a large emphasis on Systems. During my undergraduate studies,

I was fortunate to carry out applied machine learning at the Connected Devices Lab
