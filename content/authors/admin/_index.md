Pelkins was born in Limbe – a seaside city in the South West Region of Cameroon. With over 300 native languages and diverse climatic zones, Cameroon is nicknamed: "Africa in miniature". Growing up in Cameroon's diversity, Pelkins developed a global interest from childhood. This interest led him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he graduated in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, concentrating in Robotics. Pelkins is passionate about leveraging the fourth industrial revolution to [solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgiFecs6q1c) some of the world's most challenging issues. He has two years of experience using artificial intelligence to improve sensing capabilities for autonomous vehicles and has [patented](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/pelkins-ajanoh) autonomous sensing technologies. In his junior year of college, Pelkins started a tech-enabled CPG business in his native Cameroon that is empowering over 500 farmers. He is currently pursuing his interest in tech entrepreneurship through the dual [MS/MBA](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/joint-degree-programs/school-of-engineering-and-applied-sciences/Pages/default.aspx) program at Harvard Business School and Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
