I am very passionate about mentoring others and helping them realize their full potential. I co-founded [Anansi Mentorship](), with [@Twum-Ampofo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kofiapeakorang/) and [@Ermyntrude](https://mcfscholars.asu.edu/scholars/phase-ii-scholars/ermyntrude-adjei), together we are helping bridge the gap between students from Universities in Africa and opportunities around the globe. I am also a mentor on the [Elevate Mentorship program](https://sites.google.com/miafrik.org/elevate/about-us/our-mentors) and [Open Dreams Organization](https://www.open-dreams.org/) where I help high school students to secure scholarships. At Goldman Sachs, I am part of the Career Development Pillar of the Black Engineer's Network, where I help run initiatives to promote black excellence.

When I am not mentoring or leading mentorship programs, I am busy taking part in [initiatives](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6607347347779387392/) that build other people's technical skills. I also took part in a number of community give back iniatives during my time as a Mastercard Foundation Scholar. I love to travel, visit new places and learn about other people's cultures. I am an avid basketball player even though I don't play a lot these days. Please feel free to reach out if you want to colloborate on an iniative, I am always open to learning about from people's ideas.
