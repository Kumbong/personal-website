**Mentorship:** I am very passionate about mentoring and supporting others to realize their true potential. I co-founded [Anansi Mentorship](), with [@Twum-Ampofo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kofiapeakorang/) and [@Ermyntrude](https://mcfscholars.asu.edu/scholars/phase-ii-scholars/ermyntrude-adjei), together we are helping bridge the gap between students from Universities in Africa and opportunities around the globe. I am also a member of the [Elevate Mentorship program](https://sites.google.com/miafrik.org/elevate/about-us/our-mentors) where I help mentor university students back in Cameroon. At [Open Dreams Organization](https://www.open-dreams.org/), I help high-achieving, low-income high school students from Cameroon in their quest for securing scholarships to pursue a university education.

**Tutoring:** When I am not leading mentorship initiatives, I am busy taking part in [initiatives](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6607347347779387392/) that build other people's technical skills. I was the lead for Artificial Intelligence at the [KNUST Innovation Centre]() where I led several training initiatives. At Goldman Sachs, I am part of the Career Development Pillar of the Black Engineer's Network, where I help run initiatives to promote black excellence.  These experiences have hugely influenced my decision to pursue a career in academia.

**Volunteering:** I took part in a number of community give back iniatives during my time as a [Mastercard Foundation Scholar](https://mastercardfdn.org/all/scholars/). From teaching highschool students to blood donation campaigns. I cherish every opportunity I had to give back to my community and I am looking forward to doing more.

**Hobbies:** I love to travel, meet like-minded youths and brainstorm on issues facing society. I also love learning about other people's cultures. I am an avid basketball player and led highschool to win the regional basketball tournament. 

Please feel free to reach out if you want to colloborate on something, I am always open to learning from other people's ideas.
