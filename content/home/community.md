I am very passionate about mentoring others and helping them realize their full potential. I co-founded [Anansi Mentorship](), with [@Twum-Ampofo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kofiapeakorang/) and [@Ermyntrude](https://mcfscholars.asu.edu/scholars/phase-ii-scholars/ermyntrude-adjei), together we are helping bridge the gap between students from Universities in Africa and opportunities around the globe. I am also a mentor on the [Elevate Mentorship program](https://sites.google.com/miafrik.org/elevate/about-us/our-mentors) and [Open Dreams Organization](https://www.open-dreams.org/).
